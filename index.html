<p align="left">Given a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of
  appliance as "an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function". More specifically, Collins
  English Dictionary defines "home appliance" as: "devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and
  which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking". The broad usage, afforded to the definition, allows for
  nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including consumer electronics as well as
  stoves, refrigerators, toasters and air conditioners.</p>

<p align="left">While many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances
  are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied
  to the disappearance of full-time domestic servants and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit
  of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included washing machines, water heaters,
  refrigerators, kettles and sewing machines. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric clothes iron in 1903
  gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry. In the Postâ€“World War II economic expansion, the domestic
  use of dishwashers, and clothes dryers were part of a shift for convenience. Increasing discretionary income was
  reflected by a rise in miscellaneous home appliances.</p>
