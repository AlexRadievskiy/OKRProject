<h3 id="p2"><font face='Tahoma' size="2">History</font></h3>
<p align="left">While many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances
    are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied
    to the disappearance of full-time domestic servants and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit
    of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included washing machines, water heaters,
    refrigerators, kettles and sewing machines. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric clothes iron in 1903
    gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry. In the Post–World War II economic expansion, the domestic
    use of dishwashers, and clothes dryers were part of a shift for convenience. Increasing discretionary income was
    reflected by a rise in miscellaneous home appliances.</p>
